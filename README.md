# Assignment1

This program will run as a WindowsForm application. It will allow the user to play a local co-op game called O'Neillo which is based on
the game Othello. The two players will take it in turns to play against eachother, placing tiles on the board. The aim of the game is to
end up with more tiles of your colour on the board than your opponent.

The game ends when there are no more available tiles on the board for either player to place their token. 

Features for this game include:
	- Save and load game availability
	- See next available tiles
	- Text to speech
